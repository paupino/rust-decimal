[crates.io]: https://crates.io/crates/rust-decimal

A Decimal implementation written in pure Rust suitable for financial calculations that require significant integral and fractional digits with no round-off errors.

The binary representation consists of a 96 bit integer number, a scaling factor used to specify the decimal fraction and a 1 bit sign. Because of this representation, trailing zeros are preserved and may be exposed when in string form. These can be truncated using the `normalize` or `round_dp` functions.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/rust_decimal/)

## Usage

Decimal numbers can be created in a few distinct ways. The easiest and most optimal method of creating a Decimal is to use the procedural macro within the `rust_decimal_macros` crate:

```rust
// Procedural macros need importing directly
use rust_decimal_macros::*;

let number = dec!(-1.23);
```

Alternatively you can also use one of the Decimal number convenience functions:

```rust
use rust_decimal::prelude::*;

// Using an integer followed by the decimal points
let scaled = Decimal::new(202, 2); // 2.02

// From a string representation
let from_string = Decimal::from_str("2.02").unwrap(); // 2.02

// Using the `Into` trait
let my_int : Decimal = 3i32.into();

// Using the raw decimal representation
// 3.1415926535897932384626433832
let pi = Decimal::from_parts(1102470952, 185874565, 1703060790, false, 28);
```

* [std](#std)

## `db-postgres`

This feature enables a PostgreSQL communication module. It allows for reading and writing the `Decimal`
type by transparently serializing/deserializing into the `NUMERIC` data type within PostgreSQL.

## `db-tokio-postgres`

Enables the tokio postgres module allowing for async communication with PostgreSQL.

## `db-diesel-postgres`

Enable `diesel` PostgreSQL support. 

## `fast-div`

Alternative division algorithm which has significant speed improvements. This is enabled by default since it is both faster
as well as fixes some minor division bugs, however to maintain backwards compatibility can be opted out of by disabling 
default features.

## `serde-float`

Enable this so that JSON serialization of Decimal types are sent as a float instead of a string (default).

e.g. with this turned on, JSON serialization would output:
```
{
  "value": 1.234
}
```

## `serde-str`

This is typically useful for `bincode` or `csv` like implementations.

Since `bincode` does not specify type information, we need to ensure that a type hint is provided in order to 
correctly be able to deserialize. Enabling this feature on it's own will force deserialization to use `deserialize_str` 
instead of `deserialize_any`. 

If, for some reason, you also have `serde-float` enabled then this will use `deserialize_f64` as a type hint. Because
converting to `f64` _loses_ precision, it's highly recommended that you do NOT enable this feature when working with 
`bincode`. That being said, this will only use 8 bytes so is slightly more efficient in regards to storage size.

## `serde-arbitrary-precision`

This is used primarily with `serde_json` and consequently adds it as a "weak dependency". This supports the 
`arbitrary_precision` feature inside `serde_json` when parsing decimals. 

This is recommended when parsing "float" looking data as it will prevent data loss.

## `std`

Enable `std` library support. This is enabled by default, however in the future will be opt in. For now, to support `no_std`
libraries, this crate can be compiled with `--no-default-features`.
